# Overview

Blueprints in Virima provide a structured and reusable framework for modeling IT assets and their relationships within the Configuration Management Database (CMDB). Acting as templates, blueprints define the key attributes, properties, and interdependencies of different Configuration Items (CIs) such as servers, applications, network devices, or databases.

They ensure consistency and accuracy in CI representation by standardizing asset fields, enforcing integrity checks, and managing metadata. Blueprints also enable organizations to map relationships across infrastructure components, apply governance policies, and maintain a uniform approach to asset modeling.

By leveraging blueprints, IT teams can automate asset onboarding, streamline CI classification, and enhance the overall quality of CMDB data—supporting better decision-making, operational efficiency, and service management.

# Blueprints

## **Viewing a New Blueprint**

Once you have added a blueprint, Review and Validate the Blueprint.

- Double-check all configured properties, mandatory fields, and inheritance settings.

- Ensure that integrity check properties are set if the blueprint is marked as a component.

### Primary Details

**Update Picture Icon:** The Update Picture icon allows you to change or upload a new image representing the blueprint. Click this icon to browse and select a new image file.

**Created On**: The date the blueprint was created.

**Last Modified On**: The date the blueprint was last modified.

**Created By**: The user who created the blueprint.

**Last Modified By**: The user who last modified the blueprint.

### **Configure SLA (If Applicable)**

Use these steps to set up response and resolution times for any CI (Incident, Request, Change or Problem) whose Root‑Cause blueprint’s SLA should apply.

- Open the blueprint and switch to the **SLA** tab.

<img src="/assets/images/Blueprints/media/image18-1.png" />

- Set response and resolution targets for incidents, requests, changes, or problems related to this CI type.

  - **Response Time**: Enter the maximum elapsed time before a first response must occur.

  - **Resolution Time**: Enter the total time allowed for full resolution. *Note*: this value must be at least as large as the sum of your response time plus any support‑level response windows.

  - In the **Support Level** fields, specify how long each tier (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) has to respond.

- Define escalation rules, support level response windows, and notification recipients.

  - For each rule, you’ll specify when it fires, how long to wait, and who gets notified:

    - **First column**: Choose whether the escalation action fires **Before** or **After** the specified delay.

    - **Second column**: Enter the delay amount (hours/minutes) before notifications go out.

    - **Third column**: Click **Add** (for a new recipient list) or **Update** (to edit an existing one), then pick users, roles, groups or departments who should be alerted.

### SLA Escalation Rule Columns

| **When**      | **Delay**                   | **Notification Recipients**                                                              |
|---------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Before/After  | Time duration (e.g. 30 min) | Users, roles, groups, or departments (select one or many; use Add/Update to modify list) |

# Overview

The **User Groups** feature in Virima allows administrators to organize application users into structured groups based on roles, departments, and responsibilities. Each group has an assigned **Manager** and may include associated roles and departments to control access and ensure accountability.

With this module, organizations can streamline collaboration, apply role-based permissions consistently, and manage group memberships efficiently. Administrators can create new groups, add or edit member details, and remove groups when no longer needed.

# **User Groups**

## Accessing User groups

The **User Groups** function in Virima allows administrators to configure and manage groups among existing application users. Groups are defined by assigning a **Manager**, **Department**, and **Roles**, ensuring structured access control and streamlined collaboration across ITSM modules.

Before creating a new user group, ensure the following:

- **Manager** – Required (must belong to the department assigned).

- **Department** – Optional but recommended for organizational alignment.

- **Role** – Optional but recommended to apply role-based access permissions.

Role access permissions must be set up before adding a user group.

**Navigation**

Go to **Admin \> Users \> User Groups**.

- **Assign members** to groups

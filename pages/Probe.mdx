# Overview

Virima **Probes** and **Probe Workflows** automate deep, context-aware discovery across Windows, Linux, SQL and other platforms to keep the CMDB complete and current. Probes are configurable scripts (PowerShell, WMI, SQL, shell, etc.) that Sensors trigger intelligently to collect targeted system, network, and performance data; Probe Workflows organize these steps into repeatable sequences for consistent, auditable execution. Results—including outputs and timestamps—flow directly into asset records, enabling accurate inventory, faster troubleshooting, and scalable operations. This guide shows how to access and manage probes and workflows, create and customize scripts, associate probes with sensors for dynamic execution, and integrate outcomes with the CMDB for visibility and control.

# Probe

## Overview of Probe Functionality

A **probe** is a set of commands executed on a remote host, guided by a **Probe Workflow**. Probe types include:

| **Probe Type**     | **Description**                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Nmap Probe         | Network discovery and port scanning             |
| Linux System Probe | Shell commands for OS-level info on Linux hosts |
| Windows OS Probe   | PowerShell/WMI for Windows system data          |
| SQL Probe          | Database queries for configuration/status       |
| SNMP Probe         | SNMP communication for network device data      |

Probes are associated with **Sensors** to determine execution timing and targets.

## Accessing Probes Page

Within this section, you can:

- View and filter the list of existing probes

- Create new probes, either from templates or by writing custom scripts

- Assign probes to specific sensors for targeted execution

- Review details such as probe IDs, scripts, outputs, and current statuses

To access and manage probes in Virima:

**Navigate to:**  
Main Menu → **Admin → Discovery → Probes**

<img src="/assets/images/Probe/media/image1-1.png" />

The **Probes** page opens with columns like **Name**, **Description**, **Probe Type**, and **Sensor**.

## Managing Probe

On the **Probes** page, use the **Select Actions** dropdown to create new probes (from scratch or templates and assign a sensor), delete selected probes (after verifying they aren’t used by sensors or workflows), or export selected or filtered probes for download.

### Creating a New Probe

1.  From the **Select Actions** dropdown, choose **New Probe**.

<img src="/assets/images/Probe/media/image3-1.png" />

2.  Enter a **Name** and **Description**.

3.  Select a **Type** from the dropdown.

<img src="/assets/images/Probe/media/image4-1.png" />

4.  Select a **Sensor** from the dropdowns.

<img src="/assets/images/Probe/media/image5-1.png" />

5.  Enter a **Command** (for SSH/Native types).

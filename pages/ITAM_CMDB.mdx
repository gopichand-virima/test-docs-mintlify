# Overview

The **Configuration Management Database (CMDB)** in Virima serves as a centralized repository for managing and tracking **Configuration Items (CIs)**—the essential components of an IT environment. It offers a structured view of all hardware and software and their interrelationships, enabling organizations to maintain visibility and control over their IT infrastructure.

Through the CMDB interface, each CI features a detailed profile that includes technical attributes, ownership, linked components, audit history, and lifecycle information. This allows IT teams to trace dependencies, understand service impacts, and ensure accurate asset tracking.

By leveraging the CMDB, organizations can achieve:

- **Complete asset visibility** – Unified access to technical and business details of every CI.

- **Relationship mapping** – Clear visualization of interdependencies among assets.

- **Lifecycle management** – Oversight of changes, maintenance, and vulnerabilities over time.

- **Audit and compliance support** – Reliable audit logs and change records for governance.

- **Operational efficiency** – Improved incident, problem, and change management processes through accurate, up-to-date data.

In essence, Virima’s CMDB lays the foundation for effective IT service management by ensuring consistent, transparent, and actionable insights into the IT environment.

# Prerequisites

Before using the CMDB in Virima, ensure the following conditions are met:

- **CIs must exist in discovered items**

  - A CI must first appear in the *Discovered Items* list before being moved into the CMDB.

  - This requires successful **discovery scans** using valid credentials.

  - Once discovered, the CI can be formally added to the CMDB.

- **CIs must be present in the CMDB to perform actions**

  - To use CMDB actions such as **Audit, Change Attributes, Process ADM, Process Cloud/DevOps Hierarchy, Patch Report, vCenter Hierarchy**, and others, the CI must already exist in the CMDB.

  - Actions **cannot be triggered directly** from the *Discovered Items* list.

- **Linking ITSM modules to CIs**

  - To associate CIs with ITSM records (e.g., **Incidents, Requests, Changes, Problems, Known Errors, Releases, or Knowledge**), manually assign the root-cause CI during record creation in the respective module.

  - If multiple users need to be assigned for support, go to the **Users module** and add the users with the required roles. (Refer to the *User Management guide* for detailed instructions on adding users.)

# Configuration Management Database

## Accessing CMDB

From the ITSM module, open **Configuration Management**, then select **CMDB**.

This section provides access to the Configuration Management Database, where you can view, manage, and update configuration items and their relationships.

- Blueprint Type

- IP Address, Host Name

- Scan & Modification Timestamps

- Confidence Level

- Warranty, Vendor, and Location Info

This section offers a summary of the CI’s profile for quick validation.

<img src="/assets/images/ITAM_CMDB/media/image35-1.png" /><img src="/assets/images/ITAM_CMDB/media/image36-1.png" />

**How to Update:**

Use one of the following methods:

- Click a **blue hyperlink** (e.g., Windows Host) to open the function view.

- Click the **✎ pencil icon** next to a field to edit. Enter the updated information and click **Save**.

The availability of editable fields may vary based on the blueprint type or user permissions.

### Contacts on a CI

Use these cards to record who owns and supports the CI. Each card shows a profile avatar, **Name**, **Email**, and **Phone**.  
Common controls:

- **Edit** (pencil) — opens a picker to select a user or type details.

- **Remove** (×) — clears the current assignment.

- **Collapse** (–) — hides/shows the card body.

**Validation**

- Email must be a valid format (e.g., name@domain.com).

- Phone must follow standard numbering (digits, +, spaces, dashes).

- When selecting from the directory, only active users can be assigned.

**Owner**

The system assigns the logged-in user as the CI owner when adding or moving a CI record from Discovered Items to CMDB.

If the discovery process provides a user list and that user exists in the Admin → User Management directory, Virima assigns that user as the CI Owner instead of the logged-in user.

After the CI is in the CMDB, you can manually update the Owner field at any time by editing the CI record.

- **Name** – Owner’s full name (can be chosen from the user directory).

- **Email / Phone** – Auto-filled from the user record; can be edited if needed.

- **Remove** – Unassigns the owner; the CI will have no owner until one is set.

**First-Level Support *(if enabled in your environment)***

The help desk or primary support group for end-user issues.

- **Name / Email / Phone** – Primary contact for initial triage and ticket intake.

- Use **Edit** to assign a person or shared mailbox/account.

**Second Level Support**

The technical team that handles escalations from first level.

- **Name / Email / Phone** – Escalation contact(s) for deeper investigation.

- Assign an individual or the lead for a support group.

**Third Level Support**

Specialist/vendor team for complex or product-specific issues.

- **Name / Email / Phone** – Expert contact or vendor support liaison.

- Use for OEM, platform, or engineering escalations.

When a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is triggered for a Configuration Item (CI) in the Virima CMDB, the system automatically assigns the First-Level, Second-Level, and Third-Level Support contacts to the CI. These assignments are based on the support contacts defined in the CI’s profile

### Manager

The line manager for the CI Owner or support team.

- **Name / Email / Phone** – Used for escalations that require managerial action.

- Often auto-suggested when you pick an Owner (pulls org data if available).

- The selected Configuration Item (CI) will be **automatically linked** to the new record.

### Relationships

<img src="/assets/images/ITAM_CMDB/media/image64-1.png" />

The **Relationships** tab in the CMDB allows users to **view, manage, and establish connections** between a selected Configuration Item (CI) and other assets. These relationships illustrate how one CI **depends on, communicates with, or hosts** another, providing insight into infrastructure and service dependencies.

**What it does:**

The Virima Discovery application automatically detects relationship types, including:

- Installed On

- Component Of

- Runs On

- Connected To

- Communicates With

- Physically Connected To

- Used By

- Attaches

These relationships are essential for **dependency mapping**, **impact analysis**, and **visualizing business services**.

**How to use the Relationships tab:**

1.  Go to ITSM \> Configuration Management \> CMDB.

2.  Select a Configuration Item record. The Details tab opens by default.

3.  Click on the Relationships tab to view existing relationships for that CI.

4.  You can perform the following actions:

> a\) **Add Source**: Create a new source relationship.
>
> b\) **Add Target**: Add a new target CI that the asset depends on.
>
> c\) **Delete**: Select a row and remove an unwanted relationship.
>
> d\) **Business Service Map**: Open a visual view of the relationships.

**To add a relationship:**

<img src="/assets/images/ITAM_CMDB/media/image65-1.png" />

1.  Click **Add Source** or **Add Target**.

2.  In the Add Relation dialog:

> a\) Choose the asset (source or target).

**Key functionalities:**

- **Audit name**: Assign a meaningful label to indicate the audit's purpose (e.g., "detail check," "OS validation").

- **Add description**: Describe the audit's scope or objective.

- **Assign auditor**: Designate a user responsible for executing or reviewing the audit. Multiple users can be assigned.

- **Set recurring frequency**: Choose how often the audit should recur (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

- **Duration (in days)**: Specify the audit's validity duration or completion window.

**Example scenario:**

For an audit named **“detail check”**:

- It will run **daily**.

- It has a **duration of 7 days**.

- The assigned auditor is **Auditor Name**.

- The audit's description is **"check details."**

This setup enables timely verification of asset configurations and promotes regular CI hygiene practices.

### SLA

To set up response and resolution times for any CI (Incident, Request, Change, or Problem) whose Root-Cause blueprint’s SLA should apply, follow these steps:

1.  Open the SLA tab:

    - Click the desired Blueprint.

    - Resolution Time: Enter the total time allowed for full resolution. *Note*: This value must be at least the sum of your response time and any support-level response windows.

3.  Define support-level response windows:

    - In the Support Level fields, specify the response time for each tier (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).

4.  Configure escalation rules:

    1.  **First column**: Choose whether the escalation fires **before** or **after** the specified delay.

    2.  **Second column**: Enter the delay amount (hours/minutes) before notifications are sent.

    3.  **Third column**: Click **Add** (for a new recipient list) or **Update** (to edit an existing one), then select users, roles, groups, or departments to alert.

For each rule, specify when it triggers, how long to wait, and who gets notified:

| **When**         | **Delay**                       | **Notification Recipients**                                                                                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Before/After X* | Time duration (e.g. 30 minutes) | Users, roles, groups or departments (select one or many; use the Add/Update buttons to choose or modify recipients) |

5.  Once all fields and escalation rules are set, click **Save** to apply.

### Maintenance

<img src="/assets/images/ITAM_CMDB/media/image69-1.png" />

The **Vulnerability** tab offers a clear view of known security weaknesses and risks for a Configuration Item (CI). It helps identify and prioritize remediation efforts by listing vulnerabilities found during scans or integrations.

**How to use:**

1.  Navigate to **CMDB** and select a CI.

2.  Click the **Vulnerability** tab.

3.  Review CVEs and filter by severity, ID, or publish/modify date.

4.  If no records appear, the CI may have no known vulnerabilities or scanning may be pending.

**Purpose & benefit:**

- Track and manage **security risks** at the CI level.

- Maintain compliance with **vulnerability management policies**.

### Private Properties

The **Private Properties** tab in the Virima CMDB is designed for storing custom or sensitive asset attributes that may not be covered by standard fields. These properties are configured at the blueprint level, allowing organizations to tailor asset records to their unique requirements.

- Users can edit any private property and click **Save** to modify the changes.

### **Tasks**

Lists and manages tasks associated with the CI. Users can create new tasks, assign ownership, and track progress.

### **Comments**

Provides a space for administrators or users to add notes, updates, or clarifications related to the CI. This helps in collaboration and record-keeping.

### **Attachments**

Allows uploading and managing supporting files (e.g., documents, configuration files, reports, or screenshots) linked to the CI.

### **History**

Displays a detailed audit trail of all changes made to the CI. Each entry shows the action performed, the date and time of modification, the user who made the change, and the specific attributes that were updated.

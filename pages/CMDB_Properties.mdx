# CMDB Properties

# Overview

The **CMDB Properties** feature in Virima enables administrators to define and manage the descriptive attributes of Configuration Items (CIs). These properties act as metadata that capture technical, business, and operational details of assets, supporting ITSM processes such as change management, incident resolution, and service impact analysis.

Each property can be grouped, typed, and styled to align with organizational standards, ensuring consistency across the CMDB. By using CMDB Properties, IT teams gain a structured and reliable way to categorize, track, and filter configuration data—improving visibility, accuracy, and integration with broader IT service management activities.

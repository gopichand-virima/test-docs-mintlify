# Overview

The **Correlator** is a CMDB feature that identifies and reconciles applications and devices discovered across your network, then updates the CMDB while preventing duplicates. By applying blueprint-specific correlation rules that rely on unique CMDB properties (which must already be defined), it ensures a single authoritative record for each hostâ€”even when multiple scans occur. This guide shows how to access the correlation window and manage blueprint rules so you can maintain clean, accurate configuration data that improves asset management and operational efficiency.

2.  Click the **Delete** icon.

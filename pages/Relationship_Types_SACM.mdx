# Overview

The **Relationship Types** feature in Virima defines how Configuration Items (CIs) connect and interact within the SACM module. By standardizing relationship labels and their visual representation, it allows organizations to accurately model dependencies, associations, and service interactions across infrastructure, applications, and services.

Each relationship type includes both a **primary** and **reverse name**, ensuring clarity in how connections are displayed and interpreted. This functionality enhances **topology visualization**, improves **impact analysis**, and supports ITIL processes such as change management and configuration audits.

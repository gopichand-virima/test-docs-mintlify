# **Overview**

The Operational Hours feature in Virima defines the organization’s official working or business hours, ensuring that all system-driven activities—such as escalations, SLAs, scheduling, and reporting—are aligned with the company’s actual availability. Its primary purpose is to synchronize automated functions with real working timeframes, supporting use cases like incident and request management (where SLA timers run only during operational hours), defining valid windows for system maintenance and updates, and enabling accurate resource planning and reporting. Operational hours cannot be deleted, only updated or modified, which ensures that service delivery and system processes always remain consistent with the organization’s real-world schedule.

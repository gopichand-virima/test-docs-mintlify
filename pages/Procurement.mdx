# Procurement Properties & Procurement Property Group

The Procurement Custom Properties and Groups system provides a flexible, configurable framework for managing dynamic properties across various procurement entities within the Virima platform. This system enables administrators to define, modify, and organize custom fields for different procurement modules without requiring code modifications, supporting business-specific requirements and evolving organizational needs. 

The system encompasses six core procurement entity types: Requested Items, Purchase Orders, Purchase Order Line Items, Receiving Slips, Receiving Slip Lines, and Transfer Orders. Each entity type supports custom properties organized into logical groups, with comprehensive validation, audit trails, and integration capabilities.

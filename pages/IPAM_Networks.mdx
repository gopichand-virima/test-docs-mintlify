# IPAM Networks

# Overview

The **IP Address Management (IPAM)** functionality in Virima provides a centralized approach to planning, tracking, and managing IP addresses, subnets, and associated assets across the network. By integrating with Infoblox, the platform enables automated updates of IP data, eliminating manual effort and reducing reliance on separate IP management tools.

With IPAM, administrators gain visibility into subnets, address allocations, host associations, and linked hardware or software, ensuring accurate records and streamlined configuration management. This capability strengthens network security, improves efficiency, and optimizes resource utilization by maintaining a clear view of IP usage and topology.

# IPAM Procedure

The following steps outline the procedure for performing IP Address Management (IPAM) using Infoblox:

1.  **Infoblox Configuration**  
    Configure Infoblox on the system to enable integration with IPAM for effective management of IP address resources.

    - Navigate to **Admin \> Integration \> Infoblox Configuration**.

    - Set up the necessary Infoblox credentials: username, password, and host IP address.

    - Associate the credentials with the appropriate client in the system.

2.  **IPAM**  
    After configuring Infoblox, use the IPAM functionality to manage and track IP addresses, subnets, and related network details.

    - Track the total number of subnets and IP addresses in each subnet.

    - Monitor and associate IP addresses with host names, hardware, and software information.

    - Periodically re-import resource definitions and configurations from Infoblox to maintain an accurate network inventory.

# Infoblox Configuration

# IPAM Functions Overview

## Scan Function

The Scan function allows monitoring of devices and network configurations within the environment.

<img src="/assets/images/IPAM_Networks/media/image7-1.gif" />

There are two main sections under the Scan function:

- Status Update

- Regular Scan

### Status Update

The **Status Update** section checks the status of devices, typically triggered during a scan.

<img src="/assets/images/IPAM_Networks/media/image8-1.gif" />

The available settings are:

- **Probe:** Choose the type of scan, such as **Ping Scan**.

- **Client:** Select the client from the list (ensure the client is operational).

- **IP Address:** Specify the IP address or range to scan (e.g., **192.168.34.0/24**).

- **Update Type:** Choose between **Immediate** or **Scheduled** update.

  - **Immediate:** The scan starts right away.

  - **Scheduled:** The scan runs at a specified time.

### Regular Scan

The **Regular Scan** section conducts a full network scan and manages the IP address ranges to include or exclude from the scan.

<img src="/assets/images/IPAM_Networks/media/image9-1.gif" />

Fields and settings for configuring a **Regular Scan**:

- **Name:** Provide a name for the scan.

- **Probe:** Select the type of probe.

- **Client:** Select the client to scan (ensure the client is operational).

- **IP Range:** Specify the IP range to scan (e.g., **192.168.34.0/24**).

  - **Exclude IP Range:** Define specific IP ranges to exclude from the scan.

  - The maximum number of IPs allowed per scan is 1024 (Subnet /22). You can enter IPs in various formats:

    - Single or multiple IPs from different subnets: e.g., **192.168.48.1 192.168.49.2**.

    - Multiple IPs from the same subnet: e.g., **192.168.48.1,2,3,4**.

    - A range of IPs in the same subnet: e.g., **192.168.48.1-50**.

    - A single subnet: e.g., **192.168.48.0/22**.

    - Multiple subnets: e.g., **192.168.48.0/23 192.168.49.0/23**.

    - Combination of subnet and IPs: e.g., **192.168.48.0/23 192.168.48.1**.

  - The total number of IPs should not exceed 1024.

- **Location (Optional):** Specify the scan location.

- **Scan Type:** Choose between **Immediate** or **Scheduled** scan.

  - **Immediate:** The scan starts immediately.

  - **Scheduled:** The scan runs at a scheduled time.

- **Send Scan Report To (Optional):** Provide an email address for receiving scan results.

After the scan, details will appear in **Recent Scans**. Upon a successful scan, results will move to **Discovered Items** for further management.

# Overview

The **Users – Access Management** feature in Virima enables administrators to create, import, edit, and manage user accounts within the platform. It provides full control over user attributes, authentication methods, and role-based permissions, ensuring secure and structured access to the system.

Administrators can define key user details such as email, roles, departments, groups, and reporting hierarchy, while also enabling features like **VIP prioritization**, **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, and **custom landing pages**. Bulk operations, including importing new users and editing multiple records simultaneously, streamline user management for larger environments.

In addition to user creation and updates, the module supports **resource tracking**, allowing administrators to review task assignments, hours worked, and related project activities. Permanent deletion of users is also supported, with safeguards to prevent unintended impacts on reports and data integrity.

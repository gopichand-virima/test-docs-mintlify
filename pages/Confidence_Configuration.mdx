# Overview

The **Confidence Configuration** feature in Virima enables organizations to measure the freshness and reliability of Configuration Item (CI) data within the CMDB. By assigning confidence levels—such as *Very High, Medium, or Low*—based on the age of the last scan, administrators can quickly determine which records are current and which may require revalidation.

This functionality improves **trust in CMDB data**, helps **prioritize re-scanning or cleanup efforts**, and ensures decision-making is based on accurate, up-to-date information. With customizable thresholds aligned to organizational policies and discovery cycles, Confidence Configuration provides a flexible, intuitive way to maintain a cleaner and more reliable CMDB.

# Accessing the Configuration

2.  **Set Confidence Levels:**

    - In the **Confidence Level** section, you’ll see five predefined categories: Very High, High, Medium, Low, and Very Low.

    - For each level, define the **Age** threshold by entering a number and selecting a time unit (Days, Months, or Years). This determines how recent the last discovery scan must be for a CI to fall under that confidence level.

      - For example: A CI scanned within the last 7 days may be marked as **Very High** confidence, while one scanned over 45 days ago might be **Very Low**.

3.  **Save Configuration:**

    - After setting the values, click **Save** to apply the configuration.
